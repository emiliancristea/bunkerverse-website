# BUNKERVERSE Landing Page - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

A high-impact recruitment portal that immerses visitors in the BUNKERVERSE conflict and presents the Founder BunkerTag sale as an enlistment in a revolutionary war for digital freedom. The landing page serves as the primary gateway to recruit founders and establish the narrative foundation for the BUNKERVERSE ecosystem.

The project addresses the need for a compelling digital experience that transforms a typical NFT sale into a meaningful participation in a larger narrative about digital sovereignty and resistance against AI assimilation.
